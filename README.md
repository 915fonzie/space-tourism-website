## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use Framer Motion to animate pages and components.

### Continued development

I only did simple animations for my pages in this project, but I will continue to delve more into framer motion to create more complex animations.
I also want to do more projects with pages to get more familiar with the new version of react router.
